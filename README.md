# Movie-rating-prediction

## Task Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate movie ratings based on various input attributes. This involves:

* Performing data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
* Encoding categorical variables into numerical representations.
* Handling missing values using appropriate techniques.
* Engineering new, informative features to enhance the model's predictive power, such as director success rate and average rating of similar movies.
* Selecting and training a suitable machine learning model for regression.
* Evaluating the model's performance using relevant metrics on a held-out test set.

## Steps to Run Your Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd movie-rating-prediction
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment:**
    It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download Data:**
    Place the movie dataset file (e.g., `movie_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory. You might need to download this dataset from a source like Kaggle (e.g., MovieLens).

5.  **Run the Main Script:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    This script will execute the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps. The evaluation results will be printed to the console.

## Data Source

The movie rating data used for this project should be placed in the `data/movie_data.csv` file. The specific dataset used (e.g., MovieLens 100K, MovieLens Latest Small) should be mentioned here, along with the source (e.g., Kaggle, GroupLens website).

## Data Preprocessing

This project implements the following data preprocessing steps (details in `src/data_preprocessing.py`):

* **Handling Missing Values:** [Specify the strategy used, e.g., imputation with mean/median, removal].
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** [Specify the encoding techniques used for each categorical feature, e.g., One-Hot Encoding for genres and actors, Label Encoding if applicable].
* **Scaling Numerical Features:** [Specify if and how numerical features were scaled, e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler].

## Feature Engineering

The following new features were engineered to potentially improve the model's performance (details in `src/feature_engineering.py`):

* **Director Success Rate:** The average rating of movies directed by the same director.
* **Average Rating of Similar Movies:** Calculated based on shared [specify similarity criteria, e.g., genres].
* [Mention other engineered features like release year/decade, number of actors/genres, etc., if implemented].

## Model Selection

A [Specify the model used, e.g., Random Forest Regressor] model was chosen for this regression task due to its [briefly justify the choice, e.g., ability to capture non-linear relationships, robustness to outliers]. Other models might have been considered and evaluated as well.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated on a held-out test set using the following metrics (results will be printed when `src/main.py` is run):

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)

The results indicate [briefly interpret the expected outcome of the evaluation, e.g., the model's ability to predict ratings with a certain level of accuracy].

## Potential Improvements

Future work could include:

* Exploring other machine learning models.
* Implementing more sophisticated feature engineering techniques (e.g., using NLP on movie plots if available).
* Fine-tuning hyperparameters using more advanced optimization methods.
* Incorporating external data sources.
